<h3>1. Selection and Application </h3>
<p>After joining AIESEC and assuming an active role, you may start your application process. During this stage, your suitability in terms of motivation and ability to adapt will be assessed. This ensure that participants will have a positive experience while abroad on an AIESEC internship. This step will consist of completing a form and passing the review board interview.
</p>

<h3>2. Preparation </h3>
<p>In order to help guarantee a positive experience, AIESEC provides a mandatory preparation seminar for its GIP candidates. In this stage you will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Logistical preparation:</b> Ensuring that you are physically and legally prepared to work in another country (visas etc).</li>
<li><b>Community Involvement:</b> To help you gain an understanding of current global issues and those in your community.</li>
<li><b>Direct Country preparation:</b> How to cope with the pressures of living in a foreign culture, and eventually the country that you will going to.</li>
<li><b>AIESEC preparation:</b> Providing you with knowledge about the exchange program and the roles of various entities.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The preparation stage is an extremely important one as we want our participants to be ready to make the most out of their experiences, both personally and professionally speaking. We also want people to realize their roles and responsibilities when abroad.
</p>

<h3>3. Matching </h3>
<p>By this stage you have passed the selection process and became an official AIESEC exchange participant (EP). You are now able to start looking for your desired internship. You will be trained on and given access to our on-line database of internship opportunities. The more flexible you are in terms of geographical preferences and company preferences, the easier it would be to find a quick and desirable match.</p>

<h3>4. Integration </h3>

Your host AIESEC chapter will provide you with much more information on what to expect during your internship and how you can stay involved with AIESEC and the local environment.
